**CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY**

 

A concept exists in the field of molecular biology that describes steady state of genetic information within a biological system. This is called the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. Formulated by Crick and Watson in the 1950s, the pathway by which crucial instructions of the DNA are converted into functional product, mainly a protein are outlined by central dogma. The process is dissected into two main stages: transcription and translation. It can be summarized as:

This precisely captures how the genetic information that is discreetly preserved, is used to produce molecules that carry out most of the cellular functions.

At the core of its structure is Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that holds the entire map of an organism. It is composed of sequences of nucleotides, arranged in a specific manner to form units called genes. Genes contain all necessary information to build proteins, which are crucial for the proper functioning of cells.

The first step to make the flow of genetic information smooth, is transcription. During transcription, the sequence of DNA is copied into messenger RNA. This takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes. An enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of the gene and uncoils the double stranded DNA. This results in the synthesis of the complementary strand of RNA by matching the nucleotides to their DNA partners i.e. adenine pairs with thymine/uracil, guanine with cytosine. The resulting structure is mRNA molecule that is a copy of the gene’s coding sequence, in the form of RNA.

Once the molecule of mRNA is synthesized, it undergoes a process particularly in eukaryotes, which includes the addition of 5’ cap, splicing to remove non-coding introns, with poly-A tail. The mature molecule of mRNA then exits the nucleus of the cells and enters cytoplasm, where it starts its next stage called Translation.

Translation is a process by which the mRNA sequence is used to convert the already existing template into a protein. This takes place in the ribosome, a complex organelle. The ribosome reads the mRNA transcript in the sets of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon describes a particular amino acid. The tRNA molecules carry the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, where they are joined together into a polypeptide chain as dictated by the mRNA. The order of the particular amino acids determines its structure and function which ultimately defines the protein interaction with other molecules.

The central dogma accentuates the flow of genetic information in singular direction from DNA to RNA to protein. However, this model has been updated since the discovery of processes like reverse transcription, where RNA is converted back into the original molecule-DNA. This is seen in retroviruses like HIV. In addition to this, RNA can have functional roles beyond serving merely as a template for protein synthesis like the function of rRNA and tRNA. 

In conclusion, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is an analytical concept that underpins our understanding of how the genetic information is preserved, transmitted and utilized within living organisms. It provides a structure for studying gene expression, protein synthesis and various other molecular mechanism that carry life on their shoulders. It has paved an important path for the numerous scientific advancements in the fields of genetic, biotechnology and medicine.
